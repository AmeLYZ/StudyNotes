# Review of Linear Algebra  

This is a simple review of linear algebra.

## 1. Vector

There are different points of view explaining the vector.  
$$ \vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ \end {bmatrix} $$

- Computer Science
   Vectors are **ordered lists of attributes**. The length of each vector is **the dimension** of the attributes.
- Physics
   Vectors are arrows pointing in space. **The length** and **the direction** defines a vector.
- Mathematics
   Combination of the above. First we should think about **an arrow** in a coordinate  system with **the tail sitting at the origin**.

## 2. Basis Vectors & Linear Combinations

- **The basis** of a vector space is a set of **linearly independent** vectors that **span** the full space. The vectors in that set are called **basis vectors**.  
  $\hat{\boldsymbol{i}}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{j}}$ is a set of basis vector.
  - Linearly independency make sure that the set of vectors is with a minimum amount.
  - Span of vectors describes the result of linear combination by the basis is full of the space.

- **Linear combination** is the combination(scaling) of chosen basis vectors. The word linear comes from the result in which, if you only change one of the basis vectors, the result gives out a set of vectors pointing on a strait line.

## 3. Linear Transformations & Matrices

- **Linear transformation** makes the grid lines(of the coordinate system) **parallel** and **evenly spaced**.
  - Rotation of the origin
  - change of the basis vectors

## 4. Matrix Multiplication
